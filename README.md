# Empower your API with GraphQL
This repository is a starter pack for the Meetup called 'Empower your API with GraphQL'. 

## Installation

First, you'd need to restore the MongoDB dump into your MongoDB instance:

```
mongorestore â€”-db babelMeetupGraphQL dump/babelMeetupGraphQL/
```

Then, you need to install all npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```


## How to run babelMeetupGraphQL
First, ensure your ```mongod``` instance is up and running. Then, we need to build our Express app using Babeljs:
```
npm run build
```

That's it, now we can check our app is running trying to access to : http://localhost:4000
